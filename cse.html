                    <p style="color:#b69bc4">The department imparts world class training and research. The department provides state of the art computing facilities to the students. Graduates from the department are most wanted by both academia and corporates like Microsoft, Yahoo, IBM, Oracle, EMC2. All over the world, alumni of the department occupy top positions in both academia and industry especially one of the alumni occupies as Ambassador of India in Israel. Important research and technical patents are registered by our alumnus. The department has generated funds from various government organizations like AICTE, MHRD, and DST for promoting research activities and modernization.

The department has signed MOUs with companies such as Microsoft, EMC2, Robert Bosch and TCS. The objective of these MOUs is to bridge the gap between academia and industry scenario. Every year TCS recognizes department’s outstanding students by awarding “Best Student” and “Best Project” awards. The department and Oklahoma State University jointly organized and conducted an International Conference on Sensors, Security, Software and Intelligent Systems (ISSSIS 2009) during 8-10 January 2009.

Some of the major research areas which the faculty members and students working on are grid computing , cloud computing , wireless networks, database technologies , bioinformatics, image processing, software engineering data mining and web mining.</p>
